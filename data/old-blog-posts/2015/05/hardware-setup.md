I am always interested in other peoples tech stacks, both software and hardware wise, so I thought I might as well share mine. (The software one will come soon^(tm))

## What I Have
### Laptop
I use a *13" Late-2013 MacBook Pro* with a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i5 and 16GB of memory. I am very happy with both the form factor and the machine itself. After using a 15" laptop for two years and dreading having to carry it around everyday, the choice to switch to a 13" device was not a hard one. 

The harder choice was the switch to Mac. Previously, I had religiously used Windows machines, and had even changed from an iPhone to an Android phone a few months prior. My sole experience with OSX was brief tech support for my sister on her iMac. Badly in need of an upgrade, and completely undecided, I stumbled upon a great deal for this MacBook on a local classifieds website — and pulled the trigger. 

I am *very* happy I did.

The build quality of this laptop is better than any I have ever had, it basically feels bulletproof. OSX took a while to get used to, but I almost cringe when I see Windows now. (especially 8)

#### Sleeve

This very nice laptop obviously needs some protection, so I went to my local computer shop and bought a sleeve that did not break the bank but also feels like it adds significant protection. This turned out to be the Tucano [*Elements Second Skin*](http://www.tucano.com/en/designed-for/macbook/elements-second-skin.html?color=Blue) in blue. 

While the sleeve is nice and the laptop feels protected, it does not do the elegant design of the MacBook justice. I will hopefully be replacing it with a [Smooth MacBook Sleeve](http://jolioriginals.com/products/smooth-macbook) from Joli Originals soon. High—quality italian leather, local natural—wool felt and handmade in Amsterdam, those sleeves are well sexy — but also come at a high price point, I cannot justify spending just like that.

### Monitor
13" is a great size for travelling and working on—the—go, but a bigger screen is a must for serious at—home development. I went for a 24" [Dell UltraSharp U2412M](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&cs=04&l=en&sku=320-2676), which is a great monitor for little money. 

I usually have half the monitor filled up with Sublime Text, the other one with Google Chrome and the MacBook screen with the console (I use [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/), a very customisable terminal client) to immediately see the occasional build error.

### Keyboard
My keyboard is the [DasKeyboard Professional S](LINK), which I got as a gift from friends two years ago for christmas. It has served me well, and I love typing on it when I am at home. 

Next time, I am going to buy a keyboard with the UK layout though, as they are much easier to code with.

## What I want

### Coffee
Those of you who do not know me that well probably have no idea, but I am a huge coffee geek. I did the SCAE Barista Training during my time at [Animade](http://animade.tv) in London, and **love** very good coffee.

This means I cannot stand the standard brown liquid that gets sold almost everywhere as "coffee" though, which makes my morning and afternoon kick very hard to find. Thankfully, as a freelancer working remotely, I find myself at home during that time often, which makes access to excellent coffee easier. 

Unfortunately, excellent coffee requires very expensive equipment.

#### Grinder

Good quality grinders start to be available at around 750€, with professional grade options ranging into several thousands of euros. Since the grinder is much more important than the machine or method you are using to make coffee, this will be the first big investment I will make into my personal "Espresso Bar". Currently the options I am considering are (sorted from most—wanted to would—take):

- Mahlkönig K30
- VA Mythos
- Mahlkönig EK43
- Mazzer Robur
- Anfim Caimano Special
- Anfim Super Caimano
- Mazzer Super Jolly
- Mazzer Mini

#### Miband

#### Fitbit

#### Moto 360
