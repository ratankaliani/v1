Welcome to my new blog! This is its fourth or fifth redesign. Know how many blog posts I have released up until now? One.

This is going to change. I want to write more, about new things I have learned, weird bugs I have solved, new tools I try and everything inbetween. We will see how it goes, until then, check out my first blog post about animation events in JavaScript!
