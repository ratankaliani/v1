I studied Computer Science at Princeton University (Class of 2019), and I've been a Software Engineer (SWE) at Facebook since August 2019. I've done SWE internships at Facebook (2015 and 2018), Google (2016), and Airbnb (2017). I've been [programming since I was 12](/blog/how-i-became-a-programmer/) and love to build things.

A few of my more well-known projects include:

- [**generals.io**](http://generals.io) [[subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/generalsio), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13145781), [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/generals-io)], a multiplayer browser strategy game with half a million monthly players and a [Bot API](http://dev.generals.io) [[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13562866)]. Sold in January 2018.
- [**Neural Networks From Scratch**](/series/neural-networks-from-scratch), a series of 4 of my most popular blog posts in which I provide a fundamentals-oriented approach towards understanding Neural Networks.
- [**faster.js**](https://github.com/vzhou842/faster.js) [[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16886494)], a micro-optimizing Javascript compiler. I wrote a post titled [Avoid Premature Optimization](/blog/avoid-premature-optimization/) detailing a few things I learned from this experience.
- [**GeoArena Online**](https://geoarena.online) [[subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/geoarena), [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/geoarena-online)], a fast-paced multiplayer browser game that had hundreds of thousands of monthly players. I wrote a [blog post](/blog/why-you-should-use-webpack/) about some of my experiences building GeoArena. Sold in February 2019.
- [**profanity-check**](https://github.com/vzhou842/profanity-check) [[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18777950)], a fast, robust Python library to check for profanity in strings. [Read my blog post](/blog/better-profanity-detection-with-scikit-learn/) about this project.

I've spoken on a tech podcast about my experiences [building and selling games](/blog/creating-and-selling-io-games/) like generals.io and GeoArena.
