ðŸ‘‹ I am Max, the technical co-founder of [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat). Spectrum is a chat app for large online communities which GitHub acquired a year ago. We are a team of three with a predominantly frontend and design background and worked on it for three years.

Spectrum was a standard closed source product until 3rd of April, 2018, when we announced that we had [open sourced the entire codebase](https://spectrum.chat/spectrum/general/announcement-spectrum-goes-open-source~556b4915-7269-46a7-96e6-f38446d14146). Why did we decide to open source our entire product?

## The Benefits

The two big reasons for open sourcing our product were feeling good and marketing.
